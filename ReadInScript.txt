We have to keep it as text until we get rid of the second line, which contains the text of the qualtrics questions as text in each cell. R will see this second row as a string cell belonging under the column heading designated by the top row column headings. Because there is a string in each column R can't make the column numeric and read it properly. qualtrics generates the cell names for the top line automatically. It is these we will keep as they don't have spaces, which R does not like as column names. Once we get rid of this second row of column names the numeric columns just contain numbers and we can parse it properly into columns.
